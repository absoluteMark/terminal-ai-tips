### 1. Start the Conversation Freely

Begin by telling me your initial idea, goal, or question in plain English. You don't need a detailed plan.

**Example:**
> "I want to build a simple web app to track my daily reading habits."

### 2. Refine Your Ideas Through Dialogue

I will ask clarifying questions to help you flesh out your concept. This is the brainstorming phase. I can help you think about features, technologies, and potential challenges.

**Example AI Response:**
> "That's a great idea. What kind of information would you want to track for each book? Just the title, or also things like pages read per day, time spent, or personal notes?"

You can then answer, ask for suggestions, or change your mind. We'll continue this back-and-forth until you feel your plan is solid.

### 3. Save Your Plan to a File

Once you're satisfied with the plan we've developed, give me an explicit command to save it.

**Example:**
> "Okay, this is a good plan. Please save it to a file named `reading_tracker_plan.md`."

I will then use the `write_file` tool to create the document with the content we've discussed.

### 4. Implement Specific Stages of Your Plan

When you're ready to start building, you can refer to the saved plan and ask me to implement specific parts of it.

**Example:**
> "Let's start with the first step of our plan. Please create a new React component called `BookEntryForm` based on the fields we decided on in `reading_tracker_plan.md`."

### 5. Continue Your Work Later

Since your plan is saved in a file, you can easily pick up where you left off in a future session. You can ask me to read the file to refresh my memory.

**Example (in a new session):**
> "Please read the contents of `reading_tracker_plan.md` and then let's work on implementing the database schema we designed."

By following this conversational workflow, you can use me as a thinking partner to refine your ideas and then seamlessly transition into implementation when you're ready.
